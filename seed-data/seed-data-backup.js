      "Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms. The process consists of several distinct phases. In prophase, chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the nuclear envelope begins to break down. In metaphase, chromosomes align at the cellâ€™s equatorial plane, attached to spindle fibers.",
